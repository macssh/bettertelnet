========================================================================Better Telnet Conversion Release Notes========================================================================Version:  BetterTelnet 1.2.1/CodeWarrior Pro 1Date:     December 5, 1997Author:   Lawrence You========================================================================Conversion notes for conversion of BetterTelnet 1.2.1 (CW10) to CodeWarrior Pro 1.The BetterTelnet application was last built with CodeWarrior 10.  Theseare the changes that were made to convert it to CodeWarrior Pro 1(and later to CodeWarrior Pro 2).The new project builds with CodeWarrior Pro 1 as-is.  See "AdditionalNotes" below, for the steps for conversion.========================================================================New Features in This Version========================================================================*  Fat binaries*  Multiple targets, single project; new vers resource*  Metrowerks Standard Libraries (Runtime and ANSI C)========================================================================Bugs Fixed in This Version========================================================================*  Precompiled headers========================================================================Known Bugs and Incompatibilities========================================================================*  Compatible with Universal Headers using the "OLDROUTINENAMES" mode.   (i.e., the program still compiles with old-style Mac headers with   minor changes.)========================================================================Additional Notes========================================================================Following are the steps that were required to convert this applicationinto a fat binary with CodeWarrior Pro 1.*  Convert to Pro 1 with Project Converter.   Drag the two CW10 projects onto the Metrowerks conversion program,   "Project Converter 1.x" in the "Other Metrowerks Tools" folder.   This will create a newly merged project file.   *  Remove old projects   Delete the projects named projects named "telnet.68k.µ" and   "telnet.ppc.µ".*  Open new project   Open the new project with "CodeWarrior IDE 2.0" (or 2.1).*  Fix access paths   Various runtime libraries have been replaced with new versions in   CodeWarrior Pro 1 based on the Metrowerks Standard Library (MSL).      Click on the Target tab   Double-click on the "telnet.68k" target.   Select the Target:Access Paths panel.   Add "{Compiler Ä}Metrowerks Standard Library" to the System Paths.    Click Save      Do the same for the "telnet.ppc" target.   *  Use Metrowerks Standard Library for PowerPC   Click on the Files tab.   Command-click on an disclosure tab.   Find the "Main" group"   Select the "MWCRuntimeLib" file, establishing a selection where   new libraries will be added.      Choose "Add FilesÉ" from the Project menu.   Add the file "Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS Support:Libraries:Runtime:   Runtime PPC:MSL RuntimePPC.Lib"   Add it only to the "telnet.ppc" target when the dialog asks which   target to use.   Add the file "Metrowerks CodeWarrior:Metrowerks Standard Library:   MSL C:Bin:MSL SIOUX.PPC.Lib"   Add the file "Metrowerks CodeWarrior:Metrowerks Standard Library:   MSL C:Bin:MSL C.PPC.Lib"   Select "MWCRuntimeLib"   Choose "Remove Selected Items" from the Project menu.       *  Use Metrowerks Standard Library for 68K   Click on the Files tab.   Command-click on an disclosure tab.   Find the "Libraries" group"   Select the "ANSI (2i) C.68K.Lib" file, establishing a selection   where new libraries will be added.      Choose "Add FilesÉ" from the Project menu.   Add the file "Metrowerks CodeWarrior:MacOS Support:Libraries:Runtime:   Runtime 68K:MSL Runtime68K.Lib"   Add it only to the "telnet.68k" target when the dialog asks which   target to use.   Add the file "Metrowerks CodeWarrior:Metrowerks Standard Library:   MSL C:Bin:MSL SIOUX.68K.Lib"   Add the file "Metrowerks CodeWarrior:Metrowerks Standard Library:   MSL C:Bin:MSL C.68K (2i).Lib"   Select "ANSI (2i) C.68K.Lib"   Choose "Remove Selected Items" from the Project menu.    *  Create a new target for fat binaries   Choose "Create New Target" from the "Project" menu.   Type in "telnet.fat", select "Empty Target" and click OK.   Drag the target icons for "telnet.68k" and "telnet.ppc" as child   (dependent) projects under "telnet.fat".   Selecting this target (setting the black arrow) will cause   both dependent projects to be built.   Click the area under the chain icon, causing a black dot to appear   to the right of the "telnet.fat" target.  This indicates that the   two dependent projects are linked in.*  Fix precompiled headers   Copy a version of MacHeaders.c (the file that includes all of the   Mac headers) into the "telnet source Ä:source:Headers:" directory.   This will be used to create a slightly different version of the   precompiled "MacHeaders" for this project.      Edit the MacHeaders.c file just copied and change the define to be:   #define		OLDROUTINENAMES 	1      This ensures that the project builds with the old-style (pre-   Universal Headers 3.0) Macintosh API.      If any changes are made to this precompiled header, make sure to   delete the files named "TelnetHeader68K" and "TelnetHeaderPPC".      Choose "Re-search for files" from the Project menu.*  Update filenames   Change the "BetterTelnet" application (68K only) to the PowerPC   version:   Click the Targets tab.   Double-click "telnet.68k".   Select "Target:68K Target"   Change the File Name field from "BetterTelnet" to "BetterTelnet 68K"   Click Save   Close the window*  Fix the fat application target   Double-click "telnet.fat"   Select "Linker:MacOS Merge"   Check "Suppress Warnings"   Change the creator to "rlfT" (same as for 68K and PPC versions).   Click "Activate Browser" under Build Extras (you can do this for   68K and PPC projects also).   Click Save   Close the window*  Fix 'vers' version resources   Open up the telnet.68k.rsrc resource file.  Change the version   string to reflect the build is with CodeWarrior Pro 2.   ========================================================================Contacting Metrowerks========================================================================For bug reports, technical questions, and suggestions, please use theforms in the Release Notes folder on the CD, and send them tosupport@metrowerks.comSee the CodeWarrior on the Nets document in the Release Notes folder formore contact information, including a list of Internet newsgroups, online services, and patch and update sites.========================================================================Lawrence YouMetrowerks Corporation
